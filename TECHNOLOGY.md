# Technology - A list of technologies used

## Rust ü¶Ä
Rust is a low-level compiled programming language like C/C++. It is designed to be a systems programming language with a focus on safety, performance and concurrency.

## Wasi üåê
Wasi is a system interface for WebAssembly.
It provides a set of APIs for interacting with the host operating system and allows WASM modules to access system resources such as the file system and network. WASI is designed to be platform-agnostic, meaning that it can be implemented on any operating system, and it is intended to be used in both web and non-web environments.

## Wasmtime üï∞
Wasmtime is a standalone, embeddable WebAssembly runtime. It is written in Rust and is developed by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/). Wasmtime provides a low-level and customizable API for executing WebAssembly (WASM) modules, and it can be integrated into various programming languages and environments.

It provides various features for managing memory and interacting with the host operating system, and it supports different execution modes (single threaded and multi threaded) and engines ([Cranelift](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift) and Lightbeam). Wasmtime is suitable for use in a variety of contexts, such as cloud services, edge devices, and desktop applications.

## Wasmer üß¨
Wasmer is a standalone WebAssembly runtime that can run WebAssembly binaries on the Web, on the server, or on the command line. It is designed to be fast, safe, portable, and configurable.
